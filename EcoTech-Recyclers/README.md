#### EcoTech is a mobile app for reporting E-Waste effeciently and thereby reducing the damage to the environment cauesd by the E-Waste

#### Ecotech is based on a business model which makes it sustainable both for the earth and money wise

#### We use this ML Image Classifier as a first layer filter for identification of e-waste

#### Lets get started with Starting the recyclers dashboard locally

Make sure you have created a .env file locally (refer example.env)
If you have not started the backend locally, put the value for NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER=https://eco-tech.herokuapp.com

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install
foo@bar:~$ yarn dev
```

This will start the server locally at port 3000
You can access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000
(You will be redirected to login, if using prod backend username: admin-1, password: admin-1-password)

The Dashboard:
