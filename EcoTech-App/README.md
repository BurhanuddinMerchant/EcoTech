# WCE Hackathon - EcoTech App

## Welcome to the EcoTech App Repo for EcoTech

#### EcoTech is a mobile app for reporting E-Waste effeciently and thereby reducing the damage to the environment cauesd by the E-Waste

#### Ecotech is based on a business model which makes it sustainable both for the earth and money wise

#### We use this ML Image Classifier as a first layer filter for identification of e-waste

#### Lets get started with running the app locally on a mobile

1. Make sure you have **Android Studio/VS Code** with all the prerequisites from the [**Flutter Documentation**](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor) 
2. **Clone** this repository.
3. Put your mobile device in **Developer Mode** and enable **USB debugging** in the settings.
4. **Connect your device** to the laptop/computer using a USB cable.
5. Or download, install and start a **Virtual simulator**.
6. Once your device/virtual device is detected, **run** the following command:

```console
foo@bar:~$ flutter pub get
foo@bar:~$ flutter run lib/main.dart
``` 

#### Thank You very much for following along.
